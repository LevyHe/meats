Fix Code
========

These utils are old and (mostly) should probably be moved to defunct.

Originally `fixc` should have meant fix C/C++ [source code] to compile under GCC.
I was having to verify many small programs written with VS, and things like missing
include directives were getting in the way all the time.

Now it's a collection of random scripts for primitive code manipulation.
