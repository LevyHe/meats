# Image Viewer for putting images from a folder into a subfolder

## Requirements

Sometimes you already have everything necessary ;)
But this can help if there are problems with configuring the project:

`sudo apt install qt-sdk`

To configure the project:

`qmake-qt4`

and finally:

`make`

Then just run with:

`./imagesorter`
